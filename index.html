    <h2>About Talken</h2>
    <p>Talken Is A Pioneering Chat Platform Designed To Redefine The Way We Perceive Privacy In Digital Communication. Developed With Decentralization And Data Sovereignty At Its Core, Talken Offers A Seamless Experience Backed By Your Own Cloud Storage, Ensuring That Your Messages Always Remain In Your Control.</p>

    <p>It Is A Completely New Realm Of Communication Applications, Where Your Privacy Is Simply Guaranteed. In This Realm, You Also Get The Freedom To Send Absolutely Anything â€” As Long As It Is Within The Scope Of Talkenâ€™s Terms And Conditions. This Makes Talken An Ideal Choice For Journalists, Content Creators, Diplomats, And Others Who Value Discretion.</p>

    <p>Talken Can Send Any File Of Size Up To 15 GB Or The Available Space In Your Google Drive, Which Is Unmatched By Most Other Chat Applications. Each File Remains Stored Unless You Manually Delete It Through Talken Or The Google Drive App.</p>

    <p>All Media Sent Through Talken Is Preserved In Its Original Size And Quality. No Compression Is Applied, So Images And Videos Retain Their Full Clarity â€” Offering Unrestricted Freedom To Share High-Resolution Media Without Compromise.</p>

    <p>Talken Also Supports Peer-To-Peer Calling, Which Ensures That Only The Participants In The Call Know It Ever Happened. No External Servers Store Call Logs, Making Conversations Truly Private.</p>

    <p>The Application Has Been Rigorously Tested To Operate Smoothly On Low-End Systems. In Fact, It Was Developed Entirely On A Microsoft Surface Pro 5 With An Intel Core I5-7300U Processor, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, And Integrated Graphics â€” Proving Its Lightweight And Highly Optimized Build.</p>

    <h2>About The Developer</h2>
    <p>I Am Shashwat Gupta. Talken Has Been My Dream Project, One I Always Envisioned Creating On My Own. The Idea Was Born In January 2024, And By December Of That Year, I Had Finally Discovered The Technologies Required To Build It. In January 2025, I Began Development, But Had To Pause After Just Three Days Due To My Class X Pre-Board Exams.</p>

    <p>After Completing My Final Board Exams â€” In Which I Scored 95% â€” I Resumed Work On Talken On April 11, 2025. By May 22, 2025, The First Official Version Of Talken Was Ready. This Release Included Major Features Such As The Ability To Send Files Up To 15 GB In Size, Support For Custom Profile Photos And About Sections, And A Smart Profile Synchronization System That Updates Information Only When Needed â€” Enhancing Both Speed And Efficiency.</p>

    <p>I Am Currently A Student Of St. Joseph's College, Prayagraj, Studying In Class XI. I Have Built 18 GUI-Based Applications â€” 14 Of Them Using Java Swing (Which I Plan To Port To JavaFX). I Have Over 2,030 Followers On LinkedIn And Hold 11 Certifications In Java â€” One From HackerRank, Two From SoloLearn, Three From Coursera, And Five From Infosys.</p>

    <p>I Am An Intermediate Java Developer, Progressively Advancing Toward The Expert Level. I Have Strong Command Over Core Java Concepts And Have Completed Data Structures And Algorithms (DSA) Courses From Apna College And Other Platforms.</p>

    <p>My Interest In Java Sparked Only In November 2023. Prior To That, I Had Little Inclination Toward The Language. Everything I Am Today Is A Result Of Intense Self-Study And Determination Over The Past 1.5 Years. Despite Academic Pressures And Four Major Exam Seasons Each Year, I Have Managed To Build My Programming Foundation Without The Aid Of Coaching, Tuition, Or Siblings â€” Entirely Through Self-Effort.</p>
