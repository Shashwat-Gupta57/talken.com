    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 13/04/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Account & Usage</h2>
    <p>Talken is built to prioritize privacy and freedom of communication. We do not read, moderate, or censor messages sent via the app, as this would interfere with planned end-to-end encryption.</p>
    <p>However, client-side detection (inside the app) may automatically flag or prevent the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography (CP), porongraphy or extreme gore. Such activity will result in the user’s account being put under serious observation.</p>
    <p>We will never penalize users for sending legal content such as adult content. Your privacy is our top concern.</p>

    <h2>2. Google Drive Requirements</h2>
    <p>Google Drive access is mandatory for all users. Talken uses Drive to back up your chats and messages into a folder named <strong>Talken</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you remove Talken's access to your Google Drive or delete the backup folder, the app may no longer function properly.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for any data loss on your Google Drive. Backups are stored in your Drive and are your responsibility.</p>
    <p>Messages are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers. Only essential data like Group IDs and member lists are temporarily stored.</p>

    <h2>4. Account Suspension & Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your Talken account at any time. Doing so will erase all data related to you stored on our servers.</p>
    <p>Flex Studios reserves the right to suspend accounts, especially in cases involving serious content abuse or legal concerns. In most cases, we will notify the user at least 3 days before enforcing account suspension.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Content</h2>
    <p>Talken does not allow content related to child abuse (CP), Pornography , gore, or similarly harmful material. Such violations may lead to your account being flagged or suspended.</p>
    <p>We do not monitor or penalize users for content like moderate nudity, which falls within user privacy rights.</p>

    <h2>6. Updates to Terms</h2>
    <p>These terms may be updated at any time during the app’s development phase without prior notice.</p>
    <p>After launch, users will be notified about any changes via in-app alerts or email.</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed under Indian law. To the best of our knowledge, Talken complies with applicable legal standards in India.</p>
    <p>If any Indian governmental agency requests user information, we will only provide it for accounts under serious observation. All other user data remains confidential and protected.</p>
